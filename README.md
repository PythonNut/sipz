[Math 45 Group Project] Simulating Inertial Pursuit towards Zigzags

This project models the motion of objects constantly accelerating towards oscillatory paths. 
[This](https://github.com/PythonNut/sipz/blob/master/sips.ipynb) is the main project file, which contains the current version of the sumulations we ran for our report.
